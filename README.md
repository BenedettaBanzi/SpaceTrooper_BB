# SpaceTrooper
an R package for the preprocessing and quality control of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data

### Disclaimer
This is still a development version. A lot of fixing is required, please be patient for any
bug or anomaly.

Manuscript and quoting coming soon!

### Requirements
To install the package, R must be at least 4.3.2.

### Installation
```
#First try to run the following either in R or in a virgin environment:
remotes::install_github(repo="https://github.com/BenedettaBanzi/SpaceTrooper_BB", ref = "devel")

#It is highly probable that it won't finish up because some dependencies installation is a bit cumbersome.
#PLEASE, DON'T GET DISCOURAGED! Just look at the error message and jot down which packages were not successfully
#installed. Then install manually the packages either using BioCManager for Bioconductor packages or the standard 
#"install.package()" in R, or through conda or bioconda. For example:

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("scater")
```

#Then try to run again SpaceTrooper installation, now it should work fine.
It should take a couple of minutes.

### Demo
If you were able to install the package correctly, CONGRATULATIONS!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Now try to follow along the "11_15_SpaceTrooper_demo_DBKero" vignette in "vignette" folder.

Thanks for checking out!ðŸŒ¸
