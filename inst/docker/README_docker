The SpatialMoleculeAnalysis/Dockerfile contains the rules for creating a docker image
with all the R/Bioc dependencies we used so far.
In order to work with future dependencies, we need to update it.

The docker image has been build as follows:
inside the docker SpatialMoleculeAnalysis folder:
> docker build -t spatialmoleculeanalysis:1.0 drighelli/spatialmoleculeanalysis:1.0

pushing the built docker image to the docker-hub (this can be done even outside the docker SpatialMoleculeAnalysis folder)
> docker push drighelli/spatialmoleculeanalysis:1.0

The rundocker.sh file is a simple shell script to execute the compiled docker image hosted on
drighelli docker-hub
